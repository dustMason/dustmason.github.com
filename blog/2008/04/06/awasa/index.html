<div class="entry-content"><p>I could tell right away that I was going to love Ethiopia: my bus left right on time, with just one person in each seat. There weren&#8217;t mysterious, foul-smelling sacks stuffed into every crevice. The driver obeyed the speed limit and the road was smooth. At every stop, other passengers wanted to make sure I was enjoying the ride - did I need any water? A snack? It was one the best bus rides I&#8217;ve had in Africa.</p>

<p>We picked up a few passengers in Mega about an hour into the journey. An Ethiopian guy about my age took the seat next to me. I noticed that he was reading Dark Star Safari by Paul Theroux, a book I&#8217;ve seen a couple times in the hands of travelers on my up from South Africa. Its about the author&#8217;s trip from Cairo to Cape Town - my route in reverse. Since he obviously spoke English, I started up a conversation and we talked for hours - about politics, religion, travel. Tewodoros (Tedy) told me lots of interesting things about Ethiopia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethiopia has 80 different tribes. They&#8217;re everywhere. Just behind this hill here, there is a community where it is written law that the men must not ever work. They sit all day chewing chat while their wives do all of the farming. It&#8217;s crazy, but that it what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>I borrowed his book long enough to read the chapters about the same leg of travel that I had just done over the past few days (Nairobi to Moyale). It was nice to see that Theroux was as impressed as I was with the madness in northern Kenya, although he didn&#8217;t have my luck with avoiding the shifta! It doesn&#8217;t seem as if much has changed since his trip 5 years ago. I also quickly read through the chapter about his days in Sudan. If I can secure a visa, I have a lot to look forward to&#8230;</p>

<p>Tedy used to run a record shop in Addis, so I asked him for some music recomendations. I&#8217;ve heard some great/interesting/downright weird music here so far. Most of it sounds like a blend of Indian/Arabic/African styles - rhythmic, energetic music with overblown Arabic-sounding vocals.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Awasa, Tedy offered to show me around for the day and then take me to stay with his family in Addis! I was amazed - he hadn&#8217;t even been planning to go all the way to Addis, yet he gave up his entire weekend to show a random foreigner around.</p>

<p>We ended up having a good night out in Awasa. We hit every club in town (all 5 of them) and drank and danced &#8216;till the wee hours.</p>
