Since I was so tired yesterday, I couldn't be sure if it was just the delerium that was making <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org">Unclyclopedia.org</a> so funny to me, so I suspended judgement until this morning. After 14 hours of sleep and a cold <a href="http://www.zantepizza.com/">Zante Pizza</a> breakfast I <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Kitten_Huffing">went</a> <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/You_have_two_cows">back</a> and cried tears of joy once again. Someone has finally harnessed the true power of the <a href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">Wiki</a> in the name of misinformation (and inside jokes). I'm going to go play whiffle-ball now.
