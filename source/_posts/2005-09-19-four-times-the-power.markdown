I was thinking today, "What could possibly be better than Google?" Naturally that led several successive questions, like "What could possibly be 2 or 3 or <i>4 times</i> better than Google?"

Then it hit me.

I am now poised to rise up as a leader of the new NEW information age. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw that no one before me had registered...

<a href="http://www.GoogleGoogleGoogleGoogle.com">GoogleGoogleGoogleGoogle.com</a>

Yeah, I know - its already <strong>4 times better</strong> than what they got. More details to follow. I'm open to suggestions as to what it shall be, but am forming plans quickly.

If you have something of value to offer in trade, I could be persuaded to set up your very own GoogleGoogleGoogleGoogle.com email account. Things of value may include:
<ul>
<li>High fives</li>
<li>Low fives</li>
<li>Compliments</li>
<li>Reasons to live</li>
</ul>
