I know this is old news, but I just started using it again thanks to a new Wayback bookmarklet.

It works like this:
<ol>
<li>Drag this link to your browser's toolbar: <a href="javascript:location.href='http://web.archive.org/web/*/'+document.location.href;">Wayback</a></li>
<li>
When you are trying to look at a website that is no longer available, or has removed content from a page that you want to see again, or you just want to see older versions of that page just click that new toolbar link. </li></ol>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.fiftyfootfoghorn.com/">Here</a> is the archive of fiftyfootfoghorn.com.
