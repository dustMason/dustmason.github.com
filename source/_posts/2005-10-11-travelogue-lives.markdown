I have finished the bulk of the work in creating the journal set-up I will use to post entries while traveling. I am very proud of it.

It goes like this: I'm out somewhere with my notebook and small GPS unit and decide to write an entry. I write down the latitude and longitude along with my precious thoughts and email the whole thing to the mothership when I get access to the internet later on. The script that I wrote / cobbled together uses Wordpress and the Google Maps API to put a pushpin on the map at the exact location and link it to the post page. Then, the script cycles through the points in chronological order and connects them with a red line, showing my path as I travel. Each post page also gets its own tiny inset map. Fuck I'm such a nerd.
