I had a great time last night, and nearly all the things I had up for grabs were claimed! All in all, a success. I've <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/sets/1552075/">posted some photos on flickr</a>. I'm now in love with Flickr, by the way.

<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/sets/1552075/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/20/72174484_430cd47fdd_m.jpg" width="240" height="196" alt="" border="0" /><img src="http://static.flickr.com/34/72247954_005221a180_m.jpg" width="240" height="185" alt="" border="0" /></a> 
(these two photos by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/yutai/">yutai</a>)

I have a list of items that have been claimed but were not taken by the end of the night:

<ul>
	<li><s>Alvaro - Guitar</s></li>
	<li><s>Joe - Delta 44, 'Sarita' painting</s></li>
	<li><s>Yutai - Drum machines, mixer, microphone, gold frame</s></li>
	<li><s>Fong! - Rug, shelf unit thing, Tron slipmats</s></li>
	<li><s>Ryan - Pink trashcan, belt sander, skateboard</s></li>
	<li><s>Tony - Stereo receiver, croquet set, shoes</s></li>
	<li><s>Cyrelle - Robots, Lamp, Shelf unit</s></li>
	<li><s>David - Snowboard, boots, MIDI controller</s></li>
	<li>Hernan - Longboard</li>
	<li><s>Rue - Bench thing, Sarah painting</s></li>
	<li><s>Audrey - Jeremy Fish print</s></li>
	<li><s>Mayu - Computer desk</s></li>
</ul>

Hopefully you all can pick up the stuff next weekend and maybe give me a hand moving the remaining stuff into storage ;)
