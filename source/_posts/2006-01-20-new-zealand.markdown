I have arrived in Auckland, New Zealand! I will write more later.

<em>Update:</em>
I've left Auckland - I bought a bus ticket and rode to Whitianga (north of Auckland) after stopping for a couple hours at Cathedral Cove. My plan is to ride the bus around to 15 - 20 major stops around both islands, staying at hostels along the way.
Weather-wise, its nearly the complete opposite of what it was like in Japan: sunny and hot as hell. I hired a bike earlier and I'm riding around town. My next stop is to sample the so-called best hamburger in the world at the Blacksmith Kitchen. I have some photos and remaining stuff about Japan to put up soon as well. I'll turn this into a proper post as well.
