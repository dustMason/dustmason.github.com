I had a visit with my parents for two days (so short, I know) on the island of Rarotonga. We did a lot of snorkeling, ate good food and caught up with eachother. The whole time I was there it was rainy and overcast, but still hot so it wasn't bad at all. I'll definitely be returning to the Cook Islands some day.
