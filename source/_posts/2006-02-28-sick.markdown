It was bound to happen sooner or later. For the past few days I was feeling something in my throat - just a little tingling. Yesterday morning I woke up with a fever and continued to get worse and ended up not sleeping last night. Today, though, I'm feeling much better and can actually think straight. I'm guessing it was triggered by a combination of a few things:
<ul>
	<li>Cigarette smoke (2nd hand) and alcohol (1st hand)</li>
	<li>The disgusting air-quality here in HK</li>
	<li>The lack of fruit and vegetables in most food here</li>
	<li>Swallowing a couple gulps of ocean water while trying to surf on Sunday</li>
</ul>
One more day at rest and I should be right as rain! I can only waste so much more time with TV and MySpace anyway...
