After spending several days indoors resting up and recuperating, I went back to Big Wave Bay with Pete and Simon to surf on Sunday. Instead of nice small friendly waves, though, the sea was angry. There was no way I was going in, and Pete and Simon decided against it as well. The three of us ended up sitting out for a few hours to just watch.
Afterwards Pete and I met up with Sue and Steve at a bar and formed a plan to meet in Shanghai in April...
