Bangkok is wild! I arrived at Don Huang yesterday evening and caught a bus to Khao San road with the horde of fellow backpackers. Brandon had already spent a night here, so I found him at the hotel (Sawasdee Bangkok Inn) and booked a room for myself. We went out for a meal and then wandered the surrounding Khao San area, stopping for drinks here and there along the way.

Being the main backpacker drag in Bangkok, Khao San road is bright, crowded and noisy. You can't make eye contact with any one of the army of tuk-tuk drivers without being asked "where you going?"; the streets are full of food carts, minibus bars and loads of tourists. We ended up walking into a bar with a good live band playing thai cover songs and had some goofy fun with a bunch of really nice thai kids. In the morning Brandon flew to Krabi, and I had a walk around town for a couple hours before I got on a plane to Krabi as well.
