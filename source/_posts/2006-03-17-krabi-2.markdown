In Krabi again now! This morning I rode the Chao Phraya ferries up and down the river seeing some tourist stuff and taking photos before catching a taxi with Sarah to the airport. We're now in a hotel in Krabi City with plans to take a boat to one of the islands tomorrow...

PS - I've got a Thai mobile phone number now. Send me a text message! (If you call it will last all of 10 seconds or more likely not work at all because I have about 400 baht of credit). My number is 031373623. I don't know what the Thailand country code is...
