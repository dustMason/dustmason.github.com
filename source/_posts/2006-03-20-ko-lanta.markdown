Back on Lanta Yai again! At Lanta Family Resort, of course, with Thong and Mr. T :). The two and a half days we spent back here sort of melted together... many people here say the same about their 3-or-4-months-and-counting stay... At one of the bars down the beach there was a 2-day long party with several good bands and many faces I recognized from last week. One of the bands, Islander, will be playing at Lanta Family on the 26th for Thong's birthday so Sarah and I have planned to be back there in time for it. On the night of the 23rd, Sarah and I were taking photos with a bunch of friends on the sand - jumping around being goofy...

I took my wallet and phone out of my pocket and set them on the sand for a bit. When I went to find them later on, they had dissapeared! I knew it would happen sooner or later. The only important things in my wallet were my bank card (already canceled) and some cash (a couple thousand baht). Not a huge loss. Matt, a friend who works at the bar, is keeping an eye out for me in case it shows up by the time we return there on the 26th...
