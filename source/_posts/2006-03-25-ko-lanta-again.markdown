Back on Lanta yet again! Instead of going straight back Lanta Family, we dove into the horde of touts at the pier and found a place as far south as possible on Lanta Yai. After a long, extremely uncomfortable ride in the back of a pickup truck we arrived at Sunmoon Resort. All of the double rooms were booked, so they offered us a deal on two single bungalows for 150 baht / night each!

The beach here is beautiful and great for swimming, its a short hike away from a (supposedly) nice waterfall swimming-hole and its even quieter than Khong Klong beach where we were before. Tomorrow we'll go back to Lanta Family to help them set up for Thong's birthday party...
