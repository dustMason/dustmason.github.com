After the Cameron Highlands, we continued south to Kuala Lumpur.

From the bus we walked into chinatown and found a decent cheap room at Wheelers. Over the next few days we set off exploring the city and surrounds by day and hanging out in chinatown by night. I visited the monkeys at Batu caves, a couple museums and the KL tower - the standard tourist routine, really.

The hotel had a nice bar on the rooftop, so I hung out there a few times and met some nice people. One of them, Ben, performed at the bar some nights with his cousin. He had a spare guitar, so on the last two nights there I played with them at the bar and had lots of fun...
