Jeff has arrived and the three of us have been exploring Bangkok with reckless abandon! We're still at the marvelous Atlanta Hotel, of course...

After three solid days of shopping at the Baiyoke Garment Center I'm ready to send a boatload of extra crap home, which I'll do when the post office re-opens on Tuesday. Its hard to hold back when everything is so cheap! I'll be sending my computer home as well, so that plus the fact that we'll be traveling in more remote areas over the next several weeks will probably mean fewer updates until I reach a big city again (most likely Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam first). We've got a minibus ticket the Thailand/Cambodia border for Wednesday, and from there we plan to visit Siam Reap to see Angkor Wat and then continue east through Cambodia into south Vietnam, then north along the coast until we arrive in Hanoi. After that we will probably go west into Laos and then down into northern Thailand.

Tonight we have plans to go see a traditional Thai puppet show after a free show by the Thai Symphony Orchestra in Lumpini Park...
