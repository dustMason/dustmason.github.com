Dan and I went back to Phnom Penh (got a room at the same guesthouse as before - Narin) to pick up our Vietnamese visas the next morning. When we signed up for them, we were told that we had to specify a border crossing and entry date which was not flexible. Upon picking them up, though, we learned that none of that mattered at all. Our visas are good at any Cambodia/Vietnam border for any time within 30 days. So we changed plans and decided to leave for Kratie the next morning. After that, it was dinner by the riverfront and an early bedtime.
