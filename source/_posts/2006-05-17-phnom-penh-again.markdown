Defeated in our plan to get back to the captial on the Mekong, Dan and I went looking for the cheapest way to get back by road. We hit the taxi stand / bus station area of town, launched into some serious negotiations with the touts and ended up in a taxi to Kampong Cham for next to nothing (usually a costly ride, I don't know how that worked out). From there we haggled our way onto the roof of a <em>packed</em> minibus to Phnom Penh. We clung to the roof-rack like monkeys the whole way, which was actually far more comfortable than riding inside with the 30 other passengers. We went straight back to Narin Guesthouse and planned to search out a boat ride to Chau Doc for the next day.
