Nhat Ky Xe Day 3: <strong>Mai Chau</strong> -> <strong>Son La</strong>
Approx. 185km

Hiep left us in the morning on our way out to return to Hanoi and we continued west on highway 6 (He is preparing to move to London and had an appointment at the British embassy). Michael and I enjoyed the scenery on the way, stopping in Moc Chau for lunch. The roads were great, the weather was nice; It was a pleasant drive. Nothing extraordinary to comment on. When we arrived in Son La, we found a decent hotel at a good price and turned in early.
