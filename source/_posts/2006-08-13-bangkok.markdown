And now, once again, I am in Bangkok. For the past 3 weeks I've been working nearly every day on rebuilding the KitKraft website. Not much adventure to speak of, but after the craziness of Vietnam its a welcome change of pace. I did take a day off to visit the Science and Technology convention and the Mother's day / Queen's birthday festival at Wat Arun, which I'll write a post about soon. And more photos soon too. Really. I've also started reading the (Indian) Ramayana which is already breathing new meaning into my experiences around Asia. For those of you looking for the rest of the story of the mad adventure across northern Vietnam, I posted the last two entries below.

I have to do a visa run soon, so <s>I'm thinking of doing something completely wacky like flying to London for the <a href="http://www.streetwars.net">Streetwars</a> party.</s> I'm going to lovely Poipet, Cambodia tomorrow. Oh boy.
