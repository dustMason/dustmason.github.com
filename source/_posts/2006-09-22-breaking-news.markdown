<s>you heard it here first folks
pro-thaksin protest at siam square
im headed there
camera in hand
details to follow</s>

Uh, yeah, scratch all that.
The "protest" turned out to be nothing more than a press frenzy around a brief speech by some dude.
A note to all the budding junior journalists out there: don't stop for noodle soup on the way, you might miss something.
The soup was really damn good though.

Until next time,
I'll be in Khao Yai.
Drinking wine.
On a horse.
