I've been putting off this update for so many <s>weeks</s> months that the list of things I wanted to write about has grown impossibly long. Since I don't have the motivation to write out the entire story, I will boil it down to a list of highlights (with photo links):
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/newyears2007/">New years eve on Koh Phangan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/jatujakmarket/">Cock fighting at Jatujak market</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/singapore/">An extended visa-run to Singapore</a></li>
	<li>A trip to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/khaosok/">Khao Sok</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/krabi/">Krabi</a></li>
	<li>The vegetarian festival in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/phuket/">Phuket</a> (!!)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/with/284321746/">A trip to Kanchanaburi</a> with Alan and Crystal</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/kohsamet/">A trip to Koh Samet</a> (also starring Alan and Crystal)</li>
	<li>And finally, that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiftyfeet/tags/khaoyai/">trip to Khao Yai</a> mentioned in the last post here (September)</li>
</ul>
The regularly scheduled updates will, however, be returning soon. On Thursday morning Pui and I are flying to Yangon, Myanmar for a month-long (two weeks for Pui) Burmese expedition. I don't expect to have reliable internet access for most of the trip, but I will be adding entries when I can.

The current plan is to return to Bangkok on March 1st for some final weeks in Thailand before I catch an as-yet-unbooked flight to who-knows-where.
