Upon our arrival in Mandalay it was decided that the only way for Pui to catch her flight back to Bangkok on time was to book a flight to Yangon the following day. So we did. I got two tickets on Air Bagan, using up almost all of the cash I had left. It was a quiet Valentines day in dusty Mandalay...

Before hitting the airport in the morning we managed to visit the famous Mahatmuni Paya. No women allowed close to the Buddha! There was yet another novitation ceremony underway - 'tis the season apparently.
